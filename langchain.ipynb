    "Its open-source framework for building AI applications on LLM focused on composition and modularity. You can also integrate it to perfom certain  custom actions with an other external API's.\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "It is currently offered in Python and TypeScript.\n",

    "    * Prompt Templates- This allows us to avoid hardcoding text which is the input to the LLM's\n",
    "    * Indexes that allow us to extract relevant information for the LLMs\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "* Chains - Chains allow us to assemble different components that solve a specific task and build an entire application.\n",
